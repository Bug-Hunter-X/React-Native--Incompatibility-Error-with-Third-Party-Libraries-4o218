This error occurs when you are using a third-party library that is not compatible with the latest version of React Native.  For example, if you are using an older version of react-native-maps, it might not be compatible with the latest version of React Native, resulting in this error. Another scenario is when you are using an outdated version of a library that has since been updated to address compatibility issues, resulting in runtime errors.
